convert 1d array to 2d array.
external variables are not a good sign. 
separate files shows you where your dependencies are. 
1. example - minion roster should belong within masterboard. easy fix.

masterboard should handle insertion of minions.
2. use the minion constructor instead of addminion.

try to devolve activity to the classes themselves, or add new classes to act as middlemen.

eventText could be object within main which the masterboard function checks on periodically.

overall strategy: globals should become members of classes and then handed around as needed. ie. a masterboard holds a minion roster.

globals are bad- what if you want 2 masterboards? (IE for a save state)

make unit class with:
display information
hit points
movement points
armor value
etc.

using a function to access private data in place of a public data call helps to keep all of your calls in one place, instead of scattered around. editing a data access only takes one edit.
